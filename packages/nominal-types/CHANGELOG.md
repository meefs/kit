- [`85925d6`](https://github.com/anza-xyz/kit/commit/85925d64308e91b59fb748c75e4b414012eb4893) Thanks [@nickfrosty](https://github.com/nickfrosty)! - Added `AffinePoint`; a nominal type that you can use to tag a value as representing an affine point over some field that is either valid or invalid from the perspective of some curve. Typically this will be used to tag an address as either on or off curve.

### Patch Changes

- [#473](https://github.com/anza-xyz/kit/pull/473) [`36a9dee`](https://github.com/anza-xyz/kit/commit/36a9dee4e6cbd72020dc74777fe394130b9a5f46) Thanks [@steveluscher](https://github.com/steveluscher)! - The identity of all branded types has changed in such a way that the types from v2.1.1 will be compatible with any other version going forward, which is not the case for versions v2.1.0 and before.

    If you end up with a mix of versions in your project prior to v2.1.1 (eg. `@solana/addresses@2.0.0` and `@solana/addresses@2.1.0`) you may discover that branded types like `Address` raise a type error, even though they are runtime compatible. Your options are:
    1. Always make sure that you have exactly one instance of each `@solana/*` dependency in your project at any given time
    2. Upgrade all of your `@solana/*` dependencies to v2.1.1 at minimum, even if their minor or patch versions differ.
    3. Suppress the type errors using a comment like the following:
        ```ts
        const myAddress = address('1234..5678'); // from @solana/addresses@2.0.0
        const myAccount = await fetchEncodedAccount(
            // imports @solana/addresses@2.1.0
            rpc,
            // @ts-expect-error Address types mismatch between installed versions of @solana/addresses
            myAddress,
        );
        ```
