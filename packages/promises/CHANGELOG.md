- [#473](https://github.com/anza-xyz/kit/pull/473) [`36a9dee`](https://github.com/anza-xyz/kit/commit/36a9dee4e6cbd72020dc74777fe394130b9a5f46) Thanks [@steveluscher](https://github.com/steveluscher)! - The identity of all branded types has changed in such a way that the types from v2.1.1 will be compatible with any other version going forward, which is not the case for versions v2.1.0 and before.

    If you end up with a mix of versions in your project prior to v2.1.1 (eg. `@solana/addresses@2.0.0` and `@solana/addresses@2.1.0`) you may discover that branded types like `Address` raise a type error, even though they are runtime compatible. Your options are:
    1. Always make sure that you have exactly one instance of each `@solana/*` dependency in your project at any given time
    2. Upgrade all of your `@solana/*` dependencies to v2.1.1 at minimum, even if their minor or patch versions differ.
    3. Suppress the type errors using a comment like the following:
        ```ts
        const myAddress = address('1234..5678'); // from @solana/addresses@2.0.0
        const myAccount = await fetchEncodedAccount(
            // imports @solana/addresses@2.1.0
            rpc,
            // @ts-expect-error Address types mismatch between installed versions of @solana/addresses
            myAddress,
        );
        ```
