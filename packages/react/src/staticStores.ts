 * A {@link ReactiveActionStore} that never transitions out of `idle` and rejects any attempt to
 * dispatch. Returned by `useRequest` (and other action-store hooks) when their factory function
 * returns `null`, signalling that the call should be gated off — for example because a required
 * input (an address, a query string) is not yet known.
 *
 * The hook's result bridge maps this store's `idle` state to a `disabled` status so call sites
 * can distinguish "not enabled" from "loading" without an extra flag.
